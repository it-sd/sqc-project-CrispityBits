### First design hueristic: Aesthetic and Minimalistic design
I would like my site to be very simple as to direct the user to do only the things nessecary to make it work. For instance, I will make the search bar the main point and the largest part of the site as to direct the user to that as much as possible. I would like to keep my usability nuetral, as too much would allow the user to stray from the main purpose of the site.

### Second design hueristic: Recognization over recall
I want to make it so that anything that the user has typed in the past shows up as results on the side, so that rather than having to type it again the user can see the past results. I would like this to bump up my usability, as it would reduce the amount of time the user has to spend typing.
